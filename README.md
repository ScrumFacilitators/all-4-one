# All-4-ONE a cooperative Scrum game

Created by Swen-Peter Ekkebus with the help of the Scrum Facilitators. Powered by #play14 and many other Agile Friends.

# Goal
Cooperatively learn about the Scrum framework.

# Instructions
Print the 5 sheets and cut out the cards (you might do this as a starting activity). You need four players: a,b,c,d. Every player has its own unique set of 9 cards (see the letter on the meeple). The game contains 9 rounds (1 question per round) and the goal for the team of players is to determine which answer is the right one of each question, every round has only ONE right answer. During a round a player (the player with the "it's my turn" meeple) reads out loud the question During the playing rounds there are different ways to figure out the best answer together, see icons on the cards/reference cards/text below. 

The goal is to determine which answer is the right ONE for each question. Every round has only ONE right answer. Together the team discusses which answer is the right one according to the Scrum Guide 2020. Put the right answers on a central pile, discard the other cards on a seperate pile. The team can use the Scrum Guide to lookup the answers.

After all rounds have been played the team inspects if all cards on the answer pile have a black square at the right of the middle (at the top of the card). The team discusses all answers which are not correct, when needed inspects the Scrum Guide using the QR codes and adapts the answers with the right ONES.

To make it more fun, there are different ways for the team to answer (a.k. playing modes).

__‚ÄúScrum 4 all, all 4 ONE!‚Äù__
Read out loud all the answers. Everyone points their finger in the air, counts down from 3 and then points to the person with the right answer. Discuss why you think this is the right answer.

__Pull it back__
In silence read the answer on your card. Put the card with the answer face down. Count down from 3 and all together pull back and discard the card that you feel like is not correct. Together discuss which answer is the right ONE.

__Stand-up__
Everybody stands-up first. In silence read the answer on your card. Countdown from 3 and all together sit down and discard the card when you feel like your answer is not correct. Together discuss which answer is the right ONE.

_Right answer balance per player (a,b,c,d): 2,3,3,2_

When all rounds are finished. The team itself can check if their answers are right. All right answers have a black square at the third square from the left. Using the QR code the Scrum Guide can be inspected by the team.

# Future improvements
+ introduce a question without a correct answer
+ let people write down why their answer is correct (even if it's not correct)
+ make an 'Agile manifesto' version.
+ [ONLINE] point to the corner of your screen, use colours(?)
+ [ONLINE] replace voting cards with a 'playing board' for the cards (3 piles: playing, good answers, discard)?
