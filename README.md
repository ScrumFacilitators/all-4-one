# cooperative-scrum-quartet

Created by Swen-Peter Ekkebus with the help of the Scrum Facilitators.

# Goal
Cooperatively learn about the Scrum framework.

# Instructions
Print the 4 sheets and cut out the cards (you might do this as a starting activity). You need four players: a,b,c,d. Every player has its own unique set of 9 cards (see the letter on the maple). The game contains 9 rounds (1 question per round) and the goal for the team of players is to determine which answer is the right one of each question, every round has only one right answer. During a round a random player reads out loud the question and all players read out loud their answer to this question on their own card. Together the team discuss which answer is the right one according to the Scrum Guide 2021. Put the teams answer in a stack in the middle of the table.

Right answer balance: 2,2,3,2

When all rounds are finished. The team itself can check if their answers are right. All right answers have a black square at the third square from the left.
